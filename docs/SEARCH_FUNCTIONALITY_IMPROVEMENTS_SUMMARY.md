## Best Practices Implemented

### For Developers

1. **Use the enhanced search method** for comprehensive search functionality:
   ```php
   $products = $productModel->search($keyword, $filters);
   ```

2. **Implement consistent filtering** across all search implementations

3. **Provide user-friendly filtering options** in the UI

4. **Use proper pagination** for large result sets

### For Search Implementation

1. **Validate all filter parameters** before processing
2. **Sanitize search terms** to prevent SQL injection
3. **Implement proper error handling** for search failures
4. **Optimize database queries** for search performance
5. **Provide meaningful search result metadata**

## Future Enhancements

1. **Full-text search** implementation for better search relevance
2. **Search suggestions** and autocomplete functionality
3. **Search analytics** to track popular search terms
4. **Faceted search** for more advanced filtering
5. **Search result caching** for improved performance

## Conclusion
